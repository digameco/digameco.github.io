				<h4>What is Digame?</h4>
				<p>We're the world's only social network engineered around a revolutionary new blockchain, one created specifically for social media and content distribution.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="features-list">
				<h4>The 70's are back baby!!!  This time with a twist!</h4>
				<p>The user experience of Digame, is centered around our revolutionary new Push To Talk (PTT) functionality.  This is a first in the social media scene, but the idea has been around awhile now.  It functions exactly like a CB radio.  Press your friend's picture and talk to them, no matter where they are in the world! and you'll instantly be sending a short video or audio message to them.  They'll get it instantly and can reply exactly the same way.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="features-list">
				<h4>But wait, there's more!</h4>
				<p>Digame is a social network.  This means all your regular social network features, such as your feeds, your interests and your wall are all present. They're waiting for you right now to customize them and make them your very own!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="features-list">
				<h4>P2P & Secured by blockchain technology</h4>
				<p>The word blockchain is just a fancy way of saying you're using a distributed, p2p network with certain cryptographic guarantees.  Even if you don't know what one is, it's likely you've used one and if not there's a first time for everything!  For a project like Digame, the blockchain presents us with the ability to make sure that your wall, your feeds, your messages and your data stay secure. No servers are used to keep your data.  This means even if Digame went out of business tomorrow, the network can continue forever indefinetly as long as there are users.  Our design assures that no individual and no goverment can censor you, but more importantly the same cryptographic techniques that keep bitcoin going strong, are used to keep your information yours and yours alone.  You can share anything with your other Digame friends, or make anything permanently public.  It's your choice!</p>

				<h4>What makes Digame different?</h4>
				<p>Instead of a centralized database somewhere, we use a custom decentralized blockchain network.  All blockchains are pay to play.  You need a token of some sort to write data to the blockchain and the only way to get that token is to run a specialized computer application called a "miner".  The fee you pay is given to the person running the miner as a tip for keeping the blockchain secure.  You don't need to worry about any of that with Digame.  Storage on Digame is always free.  And while we have miners to secure the blockchain, the Digame currency is generated and awarded on the basis of user activity and social connections.  Miners collect income from you for each transaction, but new Digame is only generated by users doing things called "activities".  This means that most users will always have enough Digame to basically do anything they want. In a nutshell, we have "gamified" the blockchain. For more details read our whitepaper!</p>

				<h4>What does Digame mean?</h4>
				<p>Digame is spanish for "tell me".  It's how you answer the phone when talking to friends. </p>
